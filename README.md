# Machine-Learning-cancer-prediction-KNN
 Machine Learning project for cancer diagnos using Python and Sklearn
 
# Prediction
In this project, I’ve built a **KNN - Machine Learning model** to predict car prices based on various(32) features. The project includes **data cleaning, preprocessing, model training**, and **evaluation**.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to used classification models to predict whether the cancer is **benign** or **malignant**

## Steps Involved:
- **Feature selection**: selectig the useful features.
- **Data Cleaning and preprocessing**: Removing missing values and outliers.
- **Model Training**: Using K-nearest-neighbor to train the model.
- **Evaluation**: Checking the model’s performance and testing.

## Model & Evaluation
The **accuracy_score** means the model explains the model **achieved an accuracy of 95%** in cancer diagnosis, showing it works well for the given dataset.
Similarly, the **confusion matrix** supports this by providing detailed insights into the model's performance.

## About project
This project is part of my machine learning journey, where I focus on classification tasks using the KNN model.
